# ReactJs Search App

This is a test project, where I tried to use good practices in order to consume an API to show information about countries in the world. 

It will implement unit testing with jest and testing-library

In this application we can search country by name and filter countries by region. In addition, we can go to the wikipedia page for more information about each country.
